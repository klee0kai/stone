/**
 * Objects in an application can have a life cycle.
 * Various components of your application can be created, destroyed, and re-created.
 * <p>
 * At the time of re-creation of the object, it may be necessary to save the objects provided to it from DI.
 * In a normal case, this can be done by declaring an additional `@ProtectInjected` method in the component.
 * For example:
 * <pre>{@code
 *    一Component
 *     interface AppComponent {
 *
 *         void inject(Activity activity);
 *
 *        一ProtectInjected
 *         void protectInjected(Activity activity);
 *
 *     }
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * If your class can track life cycle events.
 * Then for such classes, you can implement the Stone life cycle,
 * which independently calls the deletion protection methods.
 * <p>
 * For example, for Android Activity it will look like this.
 * <pre>{@code
 *    public static StoneLifeCycleOwner lifeCycleOwner(Lifecycle lifecycle, long protectTimeMillis) {
 *         return listener -> lifecycle.addObserver(new DefaultLifecycleObserver() {
 *            一Override
 *             public void onPause(@NonNull @NotNull LifecycleOwner owner1) {
 *                 DefaultLifecycleObserver.super.onPause(owner1);
 *                 listener.protectForInjected(protectTimeMillis);
 *             }
 *         });
 *     }
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * Further, you simply use your class when injecting itself (if it implements StoneLifeCycleOwner),
 * or with an additional StoneLifeCycleOwner argument
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *   一Component
 *    interface AppComponent {
 *
 *          void inject(Activity activity, StoneLifeCycleOwner owner);
 *
 *    }
 * }</pre>
 */
public interface StoneLifeCycleOwner {

    void subscribe(StoneLifeCycleListener listener);

}
